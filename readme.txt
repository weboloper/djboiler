1. Project Setup:
Django Version: Ensure you're using the latest stable version of Django or one suited for your project.
Virtual Environment: Use virtualenv or pyenv to manage the project's dependencies.
requirements.txt or Pipfile: List all the Python dependencies here.
2. Basic Django App Structure:
settings.py: Central configuration file that includes:

DEBUG/PRODUCTION Modes: DEBUG flag and production settings.
Secret Key: Keep it in environment variables (e.g., using django-environ).
Allowed Hosts: For production deployments.
Static & Media Settings: Paths and URLs for static files (including media).
Databases: Set up databases (SQLite for dev or PostgreSQL/MySQL for production).
CORS Headers: Use django-cors-headers for API-based apps.
Email Settings: Configure email backend for sending emails (e.g., Gmail, Mailgun).
Logging: Basic logging setup.
urls.py: Routing setup for the project. Create a main urls.py for the project and then include app-level URL configurations.

wsgi.py & asgi.py: For running the application using WSGI (production) or ASGI (for async features).

3. Models, Migrations & Database Setup:
Base Models: Create abstract models that are reusable for other apps (e.g., TimestampedModel, SoftDeleteModel).
User Model: If customizing the User model (important for scaling), extend AbstractBaseUser or use AbstractUser.
Migration Files: Include the makemigrations and migrate commands.
4. Authentication & Permissions:
Custom User Model: Extend AbstractBaseUser to customize user-related features.
Login/Logout: Views and templates for handling login/logout.
Permissions & Access Control: Use IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, and permissions to secure views.
JWT Authentication: If using JWT for APIs, integrate djangorestframework-simplejwt.
Password Reset/Change: Use built-in views or create custom views for managing user passwords.
5. Static & Media Files Setup:
Static Files Handling: Use WhiteNoise or django-storages (for S3, etc.) for production static files management.
Media Files Handling: Store uploaded files in the appropriate directory (/media/) and configure access controls.
6. APIs (Optional but Recommended for Modern Apps):
Django REST Framework: Install and configure djangorestframework for API views.
Serializers: Create serializers to convert models to JSON and validate input data.
Viewsets/Generic Views: Use ModelViewSet or APIView for REST API endpoints.
Permissions & Authentication: Use built-in permission classes like IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, etc.
7. Form Handling & Validation:
Custom Forms: Create forms for user input, including model forms and custom forms.
Front-End Validation: Use Alpine.js, HTMX, or vanilla JS for basic client-side validation.
8. Error Handling:
Custom Error Pages: Set up pages for 404, 500, 403 errors, or handle in views.
Logging Setup: Configure proper logging to monitor errors and warnings.
9. Frontend Setup:
Templates Directory: Organize the templates for different apps (HTML files).
Base Template: A base template (base.html) that other templates can extend.
CSS & JS: Set up static assets (CSS, JS), integrating with frontend frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or Materialize.
Alpine.js / HTMX: If needed, set up libraries for frontend interactivity (AJAX, dynamic UI).
10. Security Enhancements:
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): CSRF protection is enabled by default, but ensure it's correctly set up in API settings.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Use django-csp to prevent XSS and other attacks.
HTTPS: Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx) to enforce HTTPS for production.
Security Headers: Set security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.
11. Caching & Performance:
Caching: Use Redis or Memcached for caching sessions and/or views.
Database Indexing: Ensure important fields like email, username, etc., have indexes to optimize queries.
Query Optimization: Ensure to use select_related and prefetch_related for better query efficiency.
12. Testing:
Test Suite: Create unit tests, functional tests, or API tests for your views, forms, and models.
Coverage: Use pytest or Django's built-in TestCase for testing.
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up integration with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for continuous deployment.
13. Deployment Configuration:
Procfile (if using Heroku): Define the commands to start the app in production.
Gunicorn: Install and configure Gunicorn for production.
Docker: If containerizing, create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for local and production builds.
Environment Variables: Use .env file for secrets (DB passwords, API keys) and keep them out of the codebase.
14. Documentation:
README: Add a comprehensive README.md with project setup instructions, features, and any specific commands.
API Docs (Swagger/OpenAPI): If providing APIs, use drf-yasg to auto-generate API documentation.

Bonus Features:
Custom Admin Panel: Customize the Django Admin panel (models, search fields, filters, etc.).
Background Tasks: Set up Celery for background task management (e.g., email sending, notifications).
User Profile Model: For extended user data (e.g., Profile model with avatars, bios, etc.).
Social Authentication: Use django-allauth or python-social-auth for third-party authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.).
